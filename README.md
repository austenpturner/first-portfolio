# My First Portfolio Page

## The Assignment
This project was my first homework assignment for UW Bootcamp.
The assignment asked us to design professional portfolio using our newly learned HTML and CSS skills. 
The portfolio was to contain an About, Portfolio and Contact page.

## The Process
I had no problems writing the HTML for the site. First I made a navigation bar and footer and copied this into all three HTML files. Next I added the unique body content for each page. 

I found the CSS to be a bit more complex. I took a mobile first approach to the stylesheet and coded my styles with a smaller screen size in mind. First I made the base styles for each page first and used resets to remove any browser default style difference. Next I added CSS styles for the navigation and footer. Figuring out how to style the body sections of each page on one stylesheet was challenging. I added a few id and class attributes to the pages so I could target and style different elements on each page. Last I added media queries for larger screen sizes. 

## The Outcome
I was happy with how my page turned out. I feel it is a good start to a portfolio page. However it is just a starting point and I will need to add *a lot* more to it as I continue to learn more. 

## Next Steps
1. I need to add actual content to the "About Me" section (instead of placeholder text)
2. Learn a server side language like PHP or Ruby so I can collect data from my contact page
3. Add my projects to the portfolio page as I make them 
4. Make the page my own! Change the colors and add different designs that showcase my skills and add some personality
